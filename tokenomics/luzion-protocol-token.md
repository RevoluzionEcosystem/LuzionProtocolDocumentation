# ðŸ“– Luzion Protocol Token

**Luzion Protocol** is a BEP-20 token which rewards its holders with automatic passive interest payments every 15 minutes and 1 hour for BUSD Reflection over the lifespan of 13.5 years until the maximum supply of 3.25 Billion tokens has been reached. &#x20;

**Is Luzion Protocol just another Safuu or Titano Fork?**

Our entire protocol's smart contract was written and developed from scratch by our own competent group of developers and team. It does not contain any resemblance to Safuu or Titano code or operation as **Luzion Protocol** works on a completely new set of mechanics which allows for complete protocol sustainability.

Luzion Protocol provides a dual reflection system which provides holders more BUSD rewards which can be used as they wish, or increase their LZN tokens and receive much more LZN tokens overtime from the auto-compound system.\

# Luzion Protocol Dividend Fund (LPDF)

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Luzion Protocol Dividend Fund (LPDF)</mark>

The LPDF serves as a BUSD Reflection to maximize profitability, stability, and long-term sustainability of the Luzion Protocol. It achieves this by maintaining a consistent 0.02355% rebase rate that is paid to all Luzion Protocol token holders, who also receive BUSD rewards directly in their wallet.&#x20;

This allows holders to use their BUSD rewards to trade or buy additional tokens without needing to sell their LZN tokens, which helps to maintain the value of the tokens over time.

The main purpose of this protocol is to ensure that users receive their insurance investment from the beginning, rather than having to wait for a specific 'event' to occur. Dividend funds are paid hourly, provided that the 1 BUSD threshold is reached and there is a buy/sell transaction to trigger the automated rewards for holders.&#x20;

Each transaction triggers automatic rewards for 2-5 users, and the dividend amount is based on the user's total token holdings. Each token has a dividend per share accuracy factor that is calculated based on the dividend amount and the total circulating amount of tokens.

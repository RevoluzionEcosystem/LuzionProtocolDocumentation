# Advantages of the LZN Protocol Over Other Protocols

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Advantages of the LZN Protocol Over Other Protocols</mark>

The security of a protocol is of the utmost importance. The Revoluzion team has put in extensive research, development, and testing to ensure that the Luzion Protocol, when deployed on the MainNet, is secure and reliable for our users' investments. We prioritize a properly functioning protocol over rushing to meet hype or deadlines.\

Key Features of the Luzion Protocol that Set it Apart ;-

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">**Developing the Luzion Protocol from the Ground Up: A Dedicated Team's Commitment to Quality**</mark> <mark style="color:yellow;"></mark><mark style="color:yellow;"></mark>&#x20;

The Luzion Protocol was developed entirely from scratch, with no copy-pasting of code. The lead full stack developer, Nizar, and his team spent hundreds of hours perfecting every aspect of the smart contract's logic to ensure its quality

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">**Fully Automated Dual Rewards System: Maximizing Benefits for LZN Holders**</mark>

The Luzion Protocol offers fully functional dual rewards through an automated staking system. By simply holding $LZN in their wallet, users can receive both LZN reflections and BUSD rewards on a perpetual basis. This helps to stabilize the market by incentivizing holders to hold onto their $LZN, rather than cashing out, as they are consistently earning BUSD rewards as profits.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Automated Rebalancing to Ensure Long-Term Sustainability</mark>

The Luzion Protocol utilizes a fully automated rebalancing system that operates until the maximum supply is reached after 13 years. This eliminates the need for users to stake their tokens on a smart contract, which can expose them to vulnerabilities and exploits. The automated rebalancing helps to ensure the long-term sustainability of the protocol.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">A Robust Rebalancing System to Maintain Token Value</mark>

The rebase rate code and logic of the Luzion Protocol are fully functioning throughout its lifespan. Unlike other protocols, the rebase rate does not need to be amended after 365 days, which helps to maintain control over the supply and prevent the mass reduction in token value over time. The Luzion Protocol's rebalancing system is robust and helps to ensure the stability and value of the token.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Automatic Token Burn to Promote Sustainability</mark>

The Luzion Protocol has a fully automated burning mechanism in place. Every transaction on the protocol automatically burns 2% of the transaction amount directly to the blackhole. This helps to reduce the overall supply of tokens and promotes sustainability.&#x20;

Other protocols may have manually-executed burns that can be manipulated or sold on the market, which does not effectively reduce the supply. The automatic burn on the Luzion Protocol ensures that the supply is consistently and transparently reduced.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Transparent Token Burn Process with a Dedicated Burn Address</mark>

Other protocols may have a "burned" address that is essentially a wallet, and burns are done manually. This can be opaque and potentially subject to manipulation. The Luzion Protocol, on the other hand, has a fully automated burning mechanism that sends burned tokens directly to an actual burn address. This ensures a transparent and tamper-proof burn process. The use of a dedicated burn address also helps to increase confidence in the protocol.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Competitive Buy and Sell Tax Rates for Investors</mark>

The Luzion Protocol offers competitive buy and sell tax rates for investors. The lower fees make it more cost-effective for investors to purchase and sell tokens on the protocol, which can encourage more participation and liquidity. These competitive tax rates are a key advantage for the Luzion Protocol in the market.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Transparent and Secure Tax Fee Structure</mark>

The Luzion Protocol has a transparent and secure tax fee structure in place. The tax fee rate is hardcoded directly into the smart contract, which ensures that it cannot be adjusted or manipulated by the team.&#x20;

This provides a high level of security for transactions on the protocol. In contrast, many other protocols may have variable tax fee rates or even no limits, which can be a cause for concern for investors. The hardcoded tax fee rate on the Luzion Protocol helps to build trust and confidence in the protocol.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Maximum Security for Treasury Funds with Hardware Wallet Storage</mark>

The Luzion Protocol utilizes a hardware wallet storage vault to ensure maximum security and safety for treasury funds. By storing all treasury funds directly in a hardware wallet, the protocol is able to prevent exploitation or hacks from occurring. The use of a hardware wallet provides an additional layer of security and helps to build trust and confidence in the protocol.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Transparency and Continuity with a Fully Doxxed Team</mark>

The entire Revoluzion team behind the Luzion Protocol is fully doxxed, with all necessary information readily available through social media profiles and other channels. The team is actively involved in the development and progress of the protocol, regularly holding Video AMAs and providing updates to the community.&#x20;

The Revoluzion team has been with the project from the start and is committed to continuously developing and updating the protocol on a daily basis. The team's transparency and dedication to the project helps to build trust and confidence in the Luzion Protocol.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">A Unique Approach to Risk Management with a Dividend Fund</mark>

Many projects have an insurance fund wallet in case of an emergency. The Luzion Protocol, however, takes a different approach to risk management by directly paying out insurance funding to users on a regular basis. This provides a risk-free investment experience for users.&#x20;

The protocol's approach is based on the belief that it is not advisable to hold a large sum of insurance funds in a single entity, and instead, it is better to have the funds distributed to users consistently. The Luzion Protocol's dividend fund is a unique approach to risk management that helps to build trust and confidence in the protocol.

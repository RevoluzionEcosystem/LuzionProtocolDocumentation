# What Is Rebase And APY?

## <mark style="color:yellow;">What Is Rebase And APY?</mark>

The annual percentage yield (APY) is a measure of the real rate of return on a principal amount of tokens, taking into account the effect of compounding interest. In the case of the Luzion Protocol, LZN tokens represent the principal and compound interest is added at regular intervals, known as rebase events, which occur every 15 minutes. The new principal amount is the current Mind token amount plus the new rebase token amount, and this total is used to calculate the next rebase rewards.

It is important to note that the balance grows exponentially over time due to compound interest. For example, with a daily compound interest rate of 2.28635%, a balance of 100 LZN tokens on day 1 would grow to approximately 383,125.800 LZN tokens after one year. This illustrates the power of compound interest and the potential for significant growth through the APY calculation.

The APY calculation is a useful tool for evaluating the potential return on an investment over a certain period of time. It is important to consider the effect of compounding interest when evaluating the potential return on an investment, as it can greatly impact the final balance.

In the case of the Luzion Protocol, LZN tokens represent the principal and compound interest is added at regular intervals, known as rebase events. The size of the rebase and the frequency at which it occurs can significantly affect the APY and the overall growth of the investment. As the balance grows through compound interest, the APY will also increase, leading to even greater potential returns.

It is worth noting that the APY calculation assumes a constant interest rate and frequency of compounding. In practice, these factors may vary and could affect the actual return on an investment. It is important to carefully consider all relevant information and perform due diligence before making any investment decisions.

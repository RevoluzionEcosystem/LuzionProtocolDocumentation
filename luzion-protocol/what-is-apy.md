# ðŸ’¹ What is APY?

**APY** stands for Annual Percentage Yield. This measures the real rate of return on your principal tokens amount by taking into account the effect of compounding interest. In the case of **Luzion Protocol**, your **LZN** tokens represent your principal, and the compound interest is added periodically on every Rebase event (Every 15 minutes).

Your new principal amount is your then current Mind token amount, plus your new rebase token amount. This total amount is what gets calculated for your next rebase rewards. The more LZN tokens hold, the more LZN tokens is received by the holder every 15 minutes.

One interesting fact about APY is that your balance will grow not linearly but exponentially over time! Assuming a daily compound interest of <mark style="color:green;"></mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">**2.28635%**</mark>, if you start with a balance of <mark style="color:green;">**100 LZN**</mark> token on day 1, after a year, your balance will grow to about <mark style="color:green;">**383,125.800 LZN Protocol**</mark>. That is the power of compound interest!

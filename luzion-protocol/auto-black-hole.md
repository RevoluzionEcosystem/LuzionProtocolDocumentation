# Auto Black Hole

<mark style="color:green;">**2%**</mark> of all **Luzion Protocol** traded are burnt in **Auto Black Hole**. The more that is traded, the more gravitational pull gets into the black hole causing the black hole to grow in size, larger and larger through self fulfilling Auto-Compounding, reducing the circulating supply and keeping the **Luzion Protocol** stable.

The other benefit to an everlasting burn of circulating supply is that due to the deflationary nature of it, equates to a higher value of each **Luzion Protocol** token, therefore increasing the individual value.\
\
The Black Hole also compounds the token in the blackhole address

#### Unlike our competitor, they don't automatically send tokens to the burn smart contract, instead, they store them in their wallet making it extremely unsafe.

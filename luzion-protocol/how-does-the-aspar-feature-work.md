### **Buy-Hold-Earn** :

* By simply buying and holding **Luzion Protocol** token in your wallet, you earn rebase rewards as interest payments directly into your wallet. Your tokens will increase <mark style="color:green;">**every 15 minutes**</mark><mark style="color:purple;">.</mark>&#x20;
* Get your BUSD rewards reflected every hour directly into your wallet.
* The more tokens the holder holds, the more tokens are accumulated over time
* The more tokens the holder holds, the more BUSD rewards are reflected over time



Using a Positive Rebase formula, **Luzion Protocol** makes it possible for token distribution to be paid directly proportional to the epoch rebase rewards, worth <mark style="color:green;"></mark> 0.02355% every 15 minute epoch period of the total amount of **Luzion Protocol** tokens held in your wallet. The rebase rewards are distributed on each EPOCH (15 minute rebase period) to all **Luzion Protocol** holders. \
\
**This means that without moving their tokens from their wallet, Luzion Protocol holders receive an annual compound interest of **<mark style="color:green;">**383,125.80%**</mark><mark style="color:green;">** **</mark><mark style="color:purple;"><mark style="color:green;">****<mark style="color:green;"></mark>** for Year 1.**&#x20;

**The interest rebase rate then reduces after the first 12 months:** [**Click Here**](broken-reference)**.**

# How does the ASPAR feature work?

## <mark style="color:yellow;">ASPAR Mechanism</mark>

The ASPAR Auto-Staking Protocol and Auto-Reflection feature, called Buy-Hold-Earn, offers a convenient and advanced way for Luzion Protocol holders to earn rebase rewards and BUSD reflections. By holding Luzion Protocol tokens in their wallet, holders can earn interest payments in the form of additional tokens, which are distributed every 15 minutes using a Positive Rebase formula.&#x20;

This formula ensures that token distribution is paid directly proportional to the epoch rebase rewards, which are worth 0.02355% of the total amount of Luzion Protocol tokens held in the wallet for each 15 minute epoch period. These rebase rewards are distributed to all Luzion Protocol holders on each epoch.

In addition to earning rebase rewards, holders can also receive BUSD reflections every hour directly in their wallet. The more tokens a holder holds, the more tokens and BUSD reflections they will earn over time. This allows Luzion Protocol holders to receive an annual compound interest rate of 383,125.80% for Year 1 without needing to move their tokens from their wallet.

1. Buy Luzion Protocol tokens and hold them in your wallet.
2. Earn rebase rewards in the form of additional tokens every 15 minutes.
3. Receive BUSD reflections every hour directly in your wallet.
4. The more tokens you hold, the more tokens and BUSD reflections you will accumulate over time.

To provide a more secure and risk-free experience for users, the project has implemented an insurance treasury fund that distributes insurance funds to users via a dividend reward style as they are earned.&#x20;

This approach eliminates the need for the project to hold onto the insurance funds on behalf of the users and allows users to receive their insurance funds in a timely manner.
{% endhint %}

In summary, Buy-Hold-Earn is a function that allows Luzion Protocol holders to earn rebase rewards and BUSD reflections simply by holding tokens in their wallet. The more tokens they hold, the more rewards they will earn. These rewards are distributed using a Positive Rebase formula and are paid out on a regular basis, providing holders with a steady stream of additional tokens and BUSD reflections.

The dividendpershareaccuracyfactor for rebase tokens is only updated on every transaction conducted by a wallet address. This means that users will be updated on their dividendpershareaccuracyfactor when they initiate a transaction. This is a result of the nature of rebase tokens.

# Long-term Interest Cycle (LIC)

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Long-term Interest Cycle (LIC)</mark>

To support the long-term sustainability and growth of the Luzion Protocol, we have implemented a Long-term Interest Cycle (LIC) feature. This feature rewards token holders with compound interest on an ongoing basis.

The LIC operates in 15-minute increments known as EPOCHs. There are 35,040 EPOCHs in a year. To maximize the benefits of the LIC, it is recommended that token holders use any BUSD rewards they receive to repurchase additional LZN.&#x20;

This increases their total LZN holdings, which in turn leads to more LZN reflections and ultimately more BUSD rewards. By repeating this process, token holders can steadily grow their wealth over time and work towards financial freedom.\

The Luzion Protocol's Long-term Interest Cycle (LIC) rewards token holders with compound interest over time. The interest rate for the LIC is as follows:

1. For the first 12 months (EPOCH 1 to 35,040), the interest rate is 0.02355% per EPOCH, resulting in an annual percentage yield (APY) of <mark style="color:yellow;">383,125.80%.</mark>
2. For the next 6 months (EPOCH 35,041 to 52,560), the interest rate is 0.00211% per EPOCH, resulting in an APY of <mark style="color:yellow;">209.45%.</mark>
3. For the next 5 years and 6 months (EPOCH 52,561 to 245,280), the interest rate is 0.00014% per EPOCH, resulting in an APY of <mark style="color:yellow;">105.02%.</mark>
4. For all subsequent EPOCHs (starting at EPOCH 245,281), the interest rate is 0.00002% per EPOCH, resulting in an APY of <mark style="color:yellow;">100.70%.</mark>

This interest is compounded and awarded to token holders on an ongoing basis until the maximum supply cap for the LZN token is reached.

# Long-term Interest Cycle (LIC)

In order to maintain sustainability and future growth, we have introduced a Long-term Interest Cycle (LIC) component which will award **Luzion Protocol** token holders with continued compound interest in perpetuity.

Each Interest Cycle is 15 minutes in length and is referred to as an **EPOCH**.&#x20;

There are 35,040 EPOCH's in 1 year.\
\
Hidden tip!\
Use those BUSD rewards received, repurchase more LZN to increase your holding. By doing so,\
you gain much more LZN reflections in return. The more LZN reflections compounded, the more BUSD rewards you receive in return. Keep on repeating to your way of financial freedom!\
